# Subnet EVM

[Avalanche](https://docs.djtx.network/learn/platform-overview) is a network composed of multiple blockchains.
Each blockchain is an instance of a Virtual Machine (VM), much like an object in an object-oriented language is an instance of a class.
That is, the VM defines the behavior of the blockchain.

Subnet EVM is the [Virtual Machine (VM)](https://docs.djtx.network/learn/platform-overview#virtual-machines) that defines the Subnet Contract Chains. Subnet EVM is a simplified version of [Coreth VM (C-Chain)](https://github.com/ava-labs/coreth).

This chain implements the Ethereum Virtual Machine and supports Solidity smart contracts as well as most other Ethereum client functionality.

## Building

The Subnet EVM runs in a separate process from the main AvalancheGo process and communicates with it over a local gRPC connection.

## API

The Subnet EVM supports the following API namespaces:

- `eth`
- `personal`
- `txpool`
- `debug`

Only the `eth` namespace is enabled by default.
Full documentation for the C-Chain's API can be found [here.](https://docs.djtx.network/build/avalanchego-apis/contract-chain-c-chain-api)

## Compatibility

The Subnet EVM is compatible with almost all Ethereum tooling, including [Remix,](https://docs.djtx.network/build/tutorials/smart-contracts/deploy-a-smart-contract-on-avalanche-using-remix-and-metamask) [Metamask](https://docs.djtx.network/build/tutorials/smart-contracts/deploy-a-smart-contract-on-avalanche-using-remix-and-metamask) and [Truffle.](https://docs.djtx.network/build/tutorials/smart-contracts/using-truffle-with-the-avalanche-c-chain)

## Differences Between Subnet EVM and Coreth

- Added configurable fees and gas limits in genesis
- Merged Avalanche hardforks into the single "Subnet EVM" hardfork
- Removed Atomic Txs and Shared Memory
- Removed Multicoin Contract and State
- Removed DAO Hardfork Support
